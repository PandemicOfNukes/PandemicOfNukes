"Dont judge a book by its cover, beginning and end. Maybe the contents of the book may surprise you. And in the book of life we are always growing."

Hi, Im PandemicOfNukes and I am a student always yearning to get better. I know several languages and have some experience with them all, some of them include: Python, Java, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, SQL, PHP

I am a lot more experienced with Linux (My favorite Distro is Artix Linux with OpenRC if you are wondering...) and management programs like Apache, PHPMyAdmin, etc.

My interests are Programming, Operating Systems, CyberSecurity, Networking and Video Games (I found a new love at making them altough many of them are simple)

I already worked in a few areas like, CyberSecurity, Technical Support and Web Developing.

This GitHub is a showcase of some of my projects (for example: Python Programs, Java Programs, some Games that I made for fun, etc.) these projects are open-source and fully editable just pull them and start typing away.

I may not be the best but I hope you like what you find here anyway.

Upcoming Projects: 

100 Levels Of Pain: A roguelike made in Godot Game Engine
